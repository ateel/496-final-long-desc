  <h1>Animal Abandonment</h1>
  <h2>It's a bigger problem than you think!</h2>
  <h3>The humane society is a wonderful resource.</h3>
  <p>It takes in 6-8 million animals annually nationwide. Thousands of people volunteer their time and it fascilitates the adoption of millions of animals every year. However, the humane society simply can't keep up with the demand. There are far too many animals brought to these shelters by owners who no longer want them. The humane society just doesn't have the resources to care for them all. Because of overcrowding, policy allows animals to be euthanized as soon as 48 hours after the arrive at a shelter.</p>

  <p>The number of in-need animals has risen 65% in the last 7 years. The number of shelters in the US has decreased to under 5,000.</p>
